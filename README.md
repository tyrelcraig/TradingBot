Current Timeline for Trading Bot:

1) Get basic API connection setup with Bittrex.
2) Get JSON encryption completed. This is to ensure the safety of API keys and secrets on your computer.
3) Test Bittrex API Connection and JSON encryption.
4) Add technical indicators. 
	- Make sure each one gives a buy or sell signal, so the program can later weight indicators and determinate action.
	- Ensure each indicator has no fixed time period.
5) Make the overarching Bot. Push the actual trading plan to another JSON.
6) Compile and run test data.

Future:
1) Other Exchange APIs.
2) AI?
